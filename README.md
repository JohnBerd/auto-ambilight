# Auto Ambilight

## purpose

I am using the Ubuntu OS

I usually dock my laptop to a docking station with a second monitor.
The problem is that I need my laptop to automatically launch the lightpack software while the led controller is plugged in.

This script will setup your laptop to automatically launch prismatic and connect to the right ttyUSB thanks to a modified binary, it will stop it when the USB is removed.

I use the cheap ambilight controller (adalight) bought from Aliexpress
